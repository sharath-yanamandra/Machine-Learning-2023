# Machine-Learning-2023
The preliminary goal of our project is to compare the different machine learning models. We chose : Support vector machine regressor, K-Nearest neighbour regressor and Multi layer  Perceptron on the given dataset. Later we validate them using 5 fold cross validation and compare on  the same dataset.
