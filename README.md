# Machine-Learning-2023
The preliminary goal of our project is to compare the different machine learning models. We chose : Support vector machine regressor, K-Nearest neighbour regressor and Multi layer  Perceptron on the given dataset. Later we validate them using 5 fold cross validation and compare on  the same dataset.

# Description of the code and data
### I divided the dataset into training and test sets, We did not touch the test until the model is ready on training data and later the test is used to assesment scripts.
