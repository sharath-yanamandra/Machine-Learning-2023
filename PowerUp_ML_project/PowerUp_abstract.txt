The preliminary goal of our project is to compare the different machine learning models. To achieve this we need to have extensive access to the chosen models and find out the best among them. Here in our project we chose: Support vector machine regressor, K-Nearest neighbour regressor and Multi layer Perceptron on the given dataset. Later we validate them using 5 fold cross validation and compare on the same dataset. According to our results the best model is Neural Network.
